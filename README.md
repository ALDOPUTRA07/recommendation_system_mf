<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Online E-commerce companies use various recommendation engines to recommend a variety of suggestions to customers. By using this recommendation system we can help e-commerce customers who are looking for similar products to purchase, it will be very helpful for them as well as e-commerce companies who are looking to provide the best recommendation system for the website or app.

This project builds a recommendation system based on Matrix Factorization.

**Note:** This project is still in Jupyter Notebook. The next step is to carry out the packaging and deploying code process.

### Built With

These are list any major frameworks/libraries used to make the project.

## Background

In the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to engage customers and boost sales. One of the most impactful technological advancements in this domain has been the advent of recommendation systems based on machine learning. These sophisticated algorithms leverage the power of artificial intelligence or machine learning to provide personalized product recommendations to online shoppers, thereby revolutionizing the way shopping online.

## How to Works
Matrix factorization is the basic idea to predict a personalized ranking over a set of items for an individual user with the similarities among users and items. Matrix factorization (MF) learns a latent space to represent a user or an item. This latent space is the feature that describes the relationship between the item and the user.

Matrix factorization characterizes items and users using vectors of factors inferred from item rating patterns. High correspondence between item and user factors leads to a recommendation.
